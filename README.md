# roll-notation-generator
Generates roll notation code for DnD Beyond's [rollable] syntax

This is something I just made in my free time to help with my prep time as I DM a campaign for my wife and children. If you have any suggestions to improve it, please create a PR. Once it's been tested out thoroughly I plan to turn it into a Chrome extension. This current version only generates [rollable] code for damage rolls, but it could be easily updated to include attack rolls as well, I just don't intend to use it for that purpose and haven't added that feature yet.

### Features
- Swap button will swap which side of the screen the modal is on (I tried making it draggable, but it turned into a mess so I just settled with this for now)
- After enter key is pressed [rollable] code is automatically generated and copied to the clipboard.

###Inputs
3 form inputs for:
- Dice Notation ex: 4d10
- Roll Action ex: Slam
- Damage Type ex: Piercing
